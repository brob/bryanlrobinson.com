It's true that I get a lot of fulfillment over writing and recording tutorials for developers and designers. That doesn't always pay the bills. I also offer a range of services for companies large and small. Whether you're looking for some extra horsepower, some key guidance or just a workshop to get your team up to speed, I've got something for your needs!

## Workshops

In this scenario, I create a customized workshop for your team. Workshop can range from a quick "Lunch and Learn" about topics like CSS Grid to full-day workshops geared toward your specific needs. I've taught hundreds of developers and multiple teams about the joys of modern coding and design. Let me help yours!

## Design Reviews

Need some additional UX or design guidance? Does your product not feel as polished as you want it? Let me take a look at your design and offer actionable advice. After over a decade in the industry and four years leading design teams, I know how to provide direction to a team of developers or designers.

## Consulting

Whether you need a few hours of CSS help, team coaching, pair programming or just someone to talk through the entire user experience of your product, I'm happy to create a customized plan just for you. Whatever your needs, we'll figure it out together.
