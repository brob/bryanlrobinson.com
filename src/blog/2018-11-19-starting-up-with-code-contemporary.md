It seems that everyone does a post like this: a bold announcement of a new journey. As of this morning, I'm beginning my new journey as an independent creator. 

I've left the comfortable confines of agency life to see what I can do creating resources for designers and developers. I'll be writing, recording, speaking and consulting. Much of this will be under the heading of my new company: [Code Contemporary](https://codecontemporary.com/). 

The site isn't too much yet, but will eventually house many of the projects I have in mind.

At the forefront of this is my first course: Practical CSS Grid. If you head over to the [Code Contemporary site](https://codecontemporary.com/) and sign up, you can get **50% off** when the course goes live later this year. The course and demos are written. All that's left is to record the videos and put it out there for the world.

Other than creating new paid courses, I plan on releasing as much free content as I can. To that end, I'll still be posting blog posts to this site, [posting videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTLrD1MTRbjxtFCRaFXqkdQ) and [reinvigigorating my Code Contemporary Newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/code-contemporary). Beyond that, I'll also be live streaming office hours each week.

## My goal by the numbers

Doing this full time will allow me to put out much more content. I plan on keeping track of this by setting some goals for myself each month.

*   A new blog post every week
*   One newsletter each week
*   Two new videos each month
*   At least 1 new course each quarter (hopefully more)
*   One-to-two office hour streams per week

As I move forward, I'm curious to find out what folks want to see and I plan on making adjustments to this. I want to do this as open as possible, which is why I'm starting with a few goals.

I'll also be revamping both this site and the Code Contemporary site to better match the things I'm doing. If no one shows up for my office hours with questions, I'll be using that time to live stream the redesigns. 

I'm excited and terrified by the future.

See you on the internet!
