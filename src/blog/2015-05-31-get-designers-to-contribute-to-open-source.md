description: I’ve been thinking a decent bit this year about how to get designers
  involved in Open Source projects. There’s more and more being talked about in this
  vein, and I don’t plan on rehashing what they talked about (The Intimidation Barrier
  and Open Source Design by Una Cravats and one of the first guiding documents --
  The Open Source Design Manifesto by Garth Braithwaite to name but a couple).

I’ve been thinking a decent bit this year about how to get designers involved in Open Source projects. There’s more and more being talked about in this vein, and I don’t plan on rehashing what they talked about ([The Intimidation Barrier](http://opendesign.foundation/articles/barriers-for-designers/) and [Open Source Design](http://una.im/open-source-design) by Una Kravets and one of the first guiding documents: [The Open Source Design Manifesto by Garth Braithwaite](http://opendesign.foundation/articles/the-open-source-design-manifesto/) to name but a couple).

Instead I want to put forth a small way of seeking designers for your project: [The Open Source Design Brief](https://github.com/brob/Design-Brief).

Let me share a secret with any non-designer reading this: Designers want to work on puzzles and challenges, not just making something pretty. By giving designers a brief of what the project is (in a way they understand), what is needed and how to contribute, you’ll lower one barrier to entry.

You’ll also specifically be telling designers: “We want you here. Please contribute.”

This document is available on [GitHub to be forked and included in your project](https://github.com/brob/Design-Brief). If you want to use it and don’t know how to write about your project in a way to draw in designers, I’d be more than happy to contribute to your project by writing this document for you (with your help, of course). Just leave a comment with a link to your repo or [hit me up on Twitter](http://twitter.com/brob).
