Streamline your layout work with the new hotness from the actual CSS specification: CSS Grid Layout. In this talk, we'll cover the basics of getting started with Grid, why and when to use Grid, advanced techniques such as Named Grid Lines, and how we can utilize this advancement to create new and unexpected web layouts.

I've presented this multiple times in 2019. Each time, I have a nearly full room (some smaller than others).
