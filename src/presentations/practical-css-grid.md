CSS Grid is taking the design and front-end world by storm. If you’re new to Grid, however, all of the new syntax may make it feel like a closed technology. What’s the difference between grid-template-rows, grid-auto-rows, grid-template-areas, implicit and explicit grids? Where did those “/”s come from? What if I have to support Internet Explorer?

In this workshop, we’ll cover all the basics and advanced maneuvers of Grid in practical, reusable components that build on each other. After a day with me, you’ll be writing Grid code in your sleep, all while building a sound foundation of practical reusable components that you can implement in any front-end project that comes your way.
