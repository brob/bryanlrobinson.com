My name is Bryan Robinson. I'm a designer, developer and teacher based in Memphis, Tenn. I've been passionate about HTML, CSS and JS for my entire career, and I want to teach you to be just as passionate about it, as well.

I've spoken nationally about modern CSS. I write regularly about CSS on my own blog, and I recently had the opportunity to write about it for CSS Tricks (still very proud of this). I've mentored designers to be developers and developers to be designers.

I've been in the industry over a decade and have worked in many capacities. [Take a look at my LinkedIn profile for a full resum√©](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryanlrobinson/)
